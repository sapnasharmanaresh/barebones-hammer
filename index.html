        <p>I've included a lot of <a href="#none">abstrast classes</a> that I regularly use for my daily web projects. Instead of including jQuery I'm using Zepto because I've realised most of the time I'm just adding toggling classes. Did I say it's always a Hammer template as well. I've included very basic styling to allow you to customise it yourself.</p>
